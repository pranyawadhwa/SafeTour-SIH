Tourist Safety and Assistance App üó∫Ô∏è
Overview
This project is an AI-powered safety and assistance application designed to protect tourists in high-risk areas. It provides a multi-layered safety net through real-time risk analysis, proactive alerts, and a direct communication channel with authorities. The app's core mission is to make travel safer by providing a dynamic and intelligent solution that goes beyond static maps and guides.

Features
Real-time Risk Choropleth Map: Displays an easy-to-understand, color-coded map showing the overall risk level of different regions (e.g., states or districts).

Incident Heatmap: Visualizes real-time user-reported alerts and incidents as "hotspots" to identify specific, high-risk locations.

Geofencing & Proactive Alerts: Automatically notifies users when they enter a pre-defined risky zone.

Panic Button: A discreet feature that instantly sends the user's live location to emergency contacts and local authorities.

AI-Powered Behavioral Analysis: The system can detect unusual behavior, such as a user deviating from their planned route or remaining stationary for too long, to flag potential risks.

Blockchain-based Incident Logging: All safety alerts and reports are securely logged on a private blockchain to ensure an immutable and tamper-proof record for authorities.

Getting Started
This project is divided into several components. To get the map visualizations working, follow these steps for the front-end part of the project:
